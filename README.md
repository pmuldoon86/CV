## Paula Muldoon

I'm a former professional violinist and keen writer who is learning to code at Makers Academy.  As a violinist, I performed and recorded throughout Europe and North America as well as in China and South America with some of the world's greatest orchestras and conductors.  I've always been fascinated with logic and organisation and decided to learn to code in order to satisfy my need for both creativity and order.

I'm looking for a junior developer role in an organisation where I can continue to learn every day.

Tech Skills: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine, PostgreSQL

Behavioural Skills: XP, TDD, Agile

## Skills

#### Discipline
In order to become a professional violinist at the highest international level, I have had to be tremendously disciplined.  Examples of this include:
- 4 hours of violin practice daily during my undergrad - while also taking a full course load of academic studies
- Summers devoted to music courses both in the USA and internationally
- 3 hours of violin practice daily while in secondary school, including commuting four hours round-trip to violin lessons and music classes in Boston

#### Creative problem-solving
Part of becoming a professional violinist is learning to practice effectively: that is, to understand and solve problems.  Some of the resources/methods I use that can transfer to coding:
- [The Bulletproof Musician](http://www.bulletproofmusician.com/blog/), a blog dedicated to evidence-based methods of intelligent practice
- Mental practice: being able to play a complicated 12-minute solo violin piece in my head has enabled me to 
  * Understand both large and small-scale structures at the same time
  * Improve focus
- Pattern recognition: music, like code, is built on blocks of patterns.  I have been trained to spot and execute patterns at lightning speed (essentially, any piece of music put in front of me I should be able to play perfectly the second time around)
- Understanding input/output: when looking at a piece of music, I have been trained to "hear" it in my head and so spot problems before I play it with my instrument; similarly, when coding I am learning to follow the logical of code in my head before I run the program

#### Writing

Examples of my writing include:
- [Fiddlers Code](www.fiddlerscode.com), my blog about my Makers Academy journey
- [Encore blog](http://blog.joinencore.com/author/paula-muldoon/): interviews, professional advice for musicians, and client-facing guides

#### Organisation
One of my previous jobs was as operations manager for a musical ensemble, with complicated logistical scenarios involving sending musicians around multiple European countries, arranging transportation for valuable musical instruments, and coordinating with the local staff.  
    * After a colleague experience an issue regarding British Airways' musical instrument policy, I started a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/british-airways-ask-british-airways-to-support-musical-instruments-as-carry-on-items) on change.org which garnered over 6,000 signatures and was written up in [The Strad](http://www.thestrad.com/violinist-forced-to-carry-unprotected-instrument-on-lap-on-british-airways-flight/), the industry magazine and the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3634929/British-Airways-passenger-says-couldn-t-bring-violin-case-board.html)

- Worked in/visited 23 different countries
- Have lived abroad for six years
