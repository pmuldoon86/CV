## Paula Muldoon

I'm a former professional violinist and keen writer who is learning to code at Makers Academy.  As a violinist, I performed and recorded throughout Europe and North America as well as in China and South America with some of the world's greatest orchestras and conductors.  I've always been fascinated with logic and organisation and decided to learn to code in order to satisfy my need for both creativity and order.

I'm looking for a junior developer role in a scientific organisation where I can continue to learn every day, be exposed to new ways of thinking, and learn about current scientific trends.  I am especially interested in neurology and mind-body connection and astronomy/space exploration.

## Skills

#### Discipline
In order to become a professional violinist at the highest international level, I have had to be tremendously disciplined.  Examples of this include:
- 4 hours of violin practice daily during my undergrad - while also taking a full course load of academic studies
- Summers devoted to music courses both in the USA and internationally
- 3 hours of violin practice daily while in secondary school, including commuting four hours round-trip to violin lessons and music classes in Boston
- While working as a freelance musician for a year after graduating, saved enough money to fund my Masters degree in London
- While working as a freelance musician in the UK, saved enough money to fund my Makers Academy course and living costs

#### Intelligent approach to problem-solving

#### Wide range of interests[FIND BETTER WORD]


#### Writing

I've always loved writing in various forms - blogs, fiction, translation, and publicity materials.  Examples of my experience include:
- [Fiddlers Code](www.fiddlerscode.com), my blog about my Makers Academy journey
- [Encore blog](http://blog.joinencore.com/author/paula-muldoon/): interviews, professional advice for musicians, and client-facing guides
- Finalist in a writing competition for a thoroughly researched novel set in Tudor England
- Award-winning poetry translation (from Latin to English)

#### Organisation
One of my previous jobs was as operations manager for a musical ensemble, with complicated logistical scenarios involving pulling musicians from several European countries to a London rehearsal, arranging transportation for valuable and fragile (and sometimes bulky!) musical instruments, and then sending the musicians off on tour while coordinating with the local staff to ensure they were properly met at the airport, that the venue was adequately prepared, and that they were returned to the airport on time (generally for several different flights) - all of which was on a shoestring budget.  Skills learned include:
 - Navigating foreign timetables
 - Keeping track of musicians' departure and destination cities (which could change quite frequently)
 - Understanding airlines' policies regarding transportation of musical instruments
    * After a colleague experience an issue regarding British Airways' musical instrument policy, I started a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/british-airways-ask-british-airways-to-support-musical-instruments-as-carry-on-items) on change.org which garnered over 6,000 signatures and was written up in [The Strad](http://www.thestrad.com/violinist-forced-to-carry-unprotected-instrument-on-lap-on-british-airways-flight/), the industry magazine and the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3634929/British-Airways-passenger-says-couldn-t-bring-violin-case-board.html)
- Helping with musicians' emotional well-being

#### Multi-culturalism

I am used to working abroad and also in the UK with people of many different nationalities.  I love experiencing new cultures and having a multi-cultural workplace.

- Proficient in Spanish
- Worked in/visited 23 different countries
- Moved abroad myself from the USA to the UK
