I submitted my application to [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) from the backstage of a concert hall in Munich before I'd written a single line of code.  I'd been fascinated by the developers' work at my startup and I knew I wanted a change from the life of a touring violinist.

I fell in love with coding while I was preparing for my Makers interview.  I love the combination of order and creativity, writing DRY code and rendering it in a beautiful view.

As a violinist, I performed and recorded throughout Europe, North and South America, and China with some of the world's greatest musicians.  I'm looking for a junior developer front-end or full-stack role in an organisation where I can continue to work at the highest possible standard.  

**Tech Skills:** Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine, PostgreSQL

**Behavioural Skills:** XP, TDD, Agile, pair programming, whole-team projects, code reviews

| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |
| [Instagram](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/instagram-challeng) | A weekend challenge to build an Instagram clone.  I used Chrome DevTools to inspect and copy the styling from Instagram.  | Ruby/Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Postgres, Devise, Paperclip |
|[Acebook](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/acebook)| Made by the whole team of 17 programmers from 5 countries working in 3 time zones during week 8 (Rails week) of the Makers Course.  I built much of the front end and also worked on building a polymorphic comment feature.  | Ruby, Sinatra, bcrypt, DataMapper, RSpec, Capybara, Postgres|
| [Chitter](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/chitter-challenge) | An Twitter clone made over a weekend after one month on the course.  As Sinatra is less automated than Rails, I manually created all the user authentication features using bcrypt.  I used partials for the views and refactored the controller logic to separate files. | Ruby/Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, bcrypt |

## Skills

#### Discipline
In order to become a professional violinist at the highest international level, I have had to be tremendously disciplined.  Examples of this include:
- 4 hours of violin practice daily during my undergrad - while also taking a full course load of academic studies
- Summers devoted to music courses both in the USA and internationally
- 3 hours of violin practice daily while in secondary school, including commuting four hours round-trip to violin lessons and music classes in Boston

#### Creative problem-solving
Part of becoming a professional violinist is learning to practice effectively: that is, to understand and solve problems.  Some of the resources/methods I use that can transfer to coding:
- [The Bulletproof Musician](http://www.bulletproofmusician.com/blog/), a blog dedicated to evidence-based methods of intelligent practice
- Mental practice: being able to play a complicated 12-minute solo violin piece in my head has enabled me to 
  * Understand both large and small-scale structures at the same time
  * Improve focus
- Pattern recognition: music, like code, is built on blocks of patterns.  I have been trained to spot and execute patterns at lightning speed (essentially, any piece of music put in front of me I should be able to play perfectly the second time around)
- Understanding input/output: when looking at a piece of music, I have been trained to "hear" it in my head and so spot problems before I play it with my instrument; similarly, when coding I am learning to follow the logical of code in my head before I run the program

#### Writing

I've always loved writing.  Examples of my work include:
- [Fiddlers Code](www.fiddlerscode.com): a blog about my Makers Academy journey
- [Encore blog](http://blog.joinencore.com/author/paula-muldoon/): interviews, professional advice for musicians, and client-facing guides

#### Organisation
One of my previous jobs was as operations manager for a musical ensemble, with complicated logistical scenarios involving sending musicians around multiple European countries, arranging transportation for valuable musical instruments, and coordinating with the local staff.  
- After a colleague experienced an issue regarding British Airways' musical instrument policy, I started a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/british-airways-ask-british-airways-to-support-musical-instruments-as-carry-on-items) on change.org asking BA to revise its violin carry-on policy.  The petition garnered over 6,000 signatures and was written up in [The Strad](http://www.thestrad.com/violinist-forced-to-carry-unprotected-instrument-on-lap-on-british-airways-flight/), the industry magazine, and the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3634929/British-Airways-passenger-says-couldn-t-bring-violin-case-board.html)

#### Community
Being on a happy and engaged team is very important to me.  While at Makers, I organised weekly virtual social evenings.  I also presented a lunch 'n learn on Alexander technique and an [evening workshop on form](http://www.fiddlerscode.com/blog/debugging-beethoven) in classical music.

- Have lived abroad for six years
